# mcudatalogger

This project contains the KiCad files for a PCB for an MCU datalogger, as part of the "[KiCad Like a Pro 3e]([url](https://www.udemy.com/course/kicad-like-a-pro-3e))" course on Udemy. The datalogger incorporates a built-in 512K EEPROM and a real-time clock to facilitate precise data collection and storage.
